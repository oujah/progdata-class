```{r }

library(tidyverse)

lotr  <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jennybc/lotr-tidy/master/data/lotr_tidy.csv") |> rename(Species = Race)

```

1. I would say this data is in the tidy format

2. Widen data showing spoken words by species

```{r}

(lotr_wider <- lotr |> pivot_wider(id_col = c(Film, Gender),
                                  names_from = Species,
                                  values_from = Words))
```


3. Re-lengthen the wide LOTR from Question 2 above

```{r}
lotr.longer <-  lotr_wider |> pivot_longer(cols = c(-Film, - Gender),
                                           names_to = "Species",
                                           values_to = "Words")
lotr.longer
```
